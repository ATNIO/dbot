# µRaiden

## Installation

### Using `virtualenv`

Run the following commands from the repository root directory.

```bash
virtualenv -p python3 env
. env/bin/activate
pip install -e microraiden
```

### Using a global `pip3` installation

```bash
sudo pip3 install -e microraiden
```

## Execution

### HTTP Proxy
There are several examples that demonstrate how to serve custom content. To try them, run one of the following commands from the `microraiden` directory:
```bash
python3 -m microraiden.examples.demo_proxy --private-key <private_key_file> start
```
or
```bash
python3 -m microraiden.examples.wikipaydia --private-key <private_key_file> --private-key-password-file <password_file> start
```
By default, the web server listens on `0.0.0.0:5000`. The private key file should be in the JSON format produced by Geth/Parity and must be readable and writable only by the owner to be accepted (`-rw-------`). A ``--private-key-password-file`` option can be specified, containing the password for the private key in the first line of the file. If it's not provided, the password will be prompted interactively.
An Ethereum node RPC interface is expected to respond on http://localhost:8545. Alternatively, you can use [Infura infrastructure](https://infura.io/) as a RPC provider.
### M2M Client
```bash
python3 -m microraiden.examples.m2m_client --key-path <path to private key file> --key-password-path <password file>
```

## Library usage

### Client
The µRaiden client backend used by the M2M sample client can be used as a standalone library. After installation, import the following class:
```python
from microraiden import Client

client = Client('<hex-encoded private key>')
```

Alternatively you can specify a path to a JSON private key, optionally specifying a file containing the password. If it's not provided, it'll be prompted interactively.
```python
client = Client(key_path='<path to private key file>', key_password_file='<path to password file>')
```

This client object allows interaction with the blockchain and offline-signing of transactions and Raiden balance proofs.

An example lifecycle of a `Client` object could look like this:

```python
from microraiden import Client

receiver = '0xb6b79519c91edbb5a0fc95f190741ad0c4b1bb4d'
privkey = '0x55e58f57ec2177ea681ee461c6d2740060fd03109036e7e6b26dcf0d16a28169'

# 'with' statement to cleanly release the client's file lock in the end.
with Client(privkey) as client:

    channel = client.get_suitable_channel(receiver, 10)
    channel.create_transfer(3)
    channel.create_transfer(4)

    print(
        'Current balance proof:\n'
        'From: {}\n'
        'To: {}\n'
        'Channel opened at block: #{}\n'  # used to uniquely identify this channel
        'Balance: {}\n'                   # total: 7
        'Signature: {}\n'                 # valid signature for a balance of 7 on this channel
        .format(
            channel.sender, channel.receiver, channel.block, channel.balance, channel.balance_sig
        )
    )

    channel.topup(5)                      # total deposit: 15

    channel.create_transfer(5)            # total balance: 12

    channel.close()

    # Wait for settlement period to end.

    channel.settle()

    # Instead of requesting a close and waiting for the settlement period to end, you can also perform
    # a cooperative close, provided that you have a receiver-signed balance proof that matches your
    # current channel balance.

    channel.close_cooperatively(closing_sig)
```

The values required for a valid balance proof required by the receiver end are printed above. Make sure to let them know.
